# Consumption over Time v. Biomass over Time Analysis:
## These are some questions that I have been coming across:
1. For Blue Fish there is only one sample taken in spring throughout the whole time series; what should we do with this?
2. White Hake each have one outlier in spring (1981 C, 1990 B) and fall (1982 C, 1980 B) in their consumption and biomass. Are these related/how do I deal with these outlier points?
3. Similar thing in Pollock around a similar time frame
4. Similar thing in Thorny Skate in similar time frame
5. I ran what I think is a random walk model, is it correct?
6. How do we incorporate the confidence intervals that are already given

## Here is a running list of species that have near 0 biomass estimates at a minimum of one point in time in the time series:
- Goosefish (spring)
